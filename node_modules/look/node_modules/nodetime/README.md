Nodetime - Performance Profiler and Monitor for Node.js Applications
===========================================
Nodetime reveals response time and other internals of HTTP requests and underlying HTTP, database, file system and other API calls in your Node.js application. Coupled with related process and OS state information, real-time and historical metrics, monitoring as well as CPU and memory profiling it enables tracing performance problems down to the root cause. Nodetime supports multiple APIs including native HTTP client, file system, cluster and sockets, Socket.io, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Memcached and Cassandra. HTTP based data stores like CouchDB and Riak are supported via HTTP API.

The profiler running within the application securely sends profiling data to the Nodetime server, which forwards it to a browser in real-time.

Nodetime is a high level profiler designed to run in production environments. By hooking up to various APIs it gives developers clear API level visibility of performance, i.e. time and CPU usage, averages, stack traces and much more.
